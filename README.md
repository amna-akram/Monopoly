# Game Rules
- All game rules are similar to the Monopoly Game.
-	The game starts with Go cell, and each player rolls the six sided dice and moves forward in clock wise direction.
-	The objective of the game is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling property. 
-	Each Player gets 1500$ in the start.
-	16 community chest cards and 16 chance cards are set on the board after shuffling.
-	Whenever a round is completed and player crosses the Go cell again he will collect 1500$ from the bank as the salary.
-	The game can have 2-8 players
-	If a player lands on an un-owned property, she/he will be given the option of buying it for its listed purchase price.
-	If he declines this purchase offer, the property is auctioned off by the bank to the highest bidder, including the player who declined to buy. 
-	If the property landed on is already owned, he must pay the owner a given rent for un-mortgaged property. However, the price depends on if the property is part of a set, upgraded or a utility.
-	Once the player owns the entire set, she/he can get double rent from that property set. The property can also be upgraded now, that is, the owner can set up hotels and houses.
-	Players can take loan from the bank if needed. For example, if one player wants to buy a hotel and does not have enough money but sees profit in the action, she/he may choose to take loan from the bank.
-	Players can owe each other till the time they can pay each other off but hey cannot loan each other money.
-	Players are eliminated, one by one, when they owe more than they can pay.
-	If a player goes bankrupt to another player, he turns over everything he has of value (cash and any property (except hotels or houses) he owns) to the player he owes money to.
